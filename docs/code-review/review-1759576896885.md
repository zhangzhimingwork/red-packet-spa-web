## 游댮 HIGH

**src/components/WalletConnect.tsx**
- The code uses console.log statements to log sensitive information such as ensName, ensAvatar, isConnected, requireAuth, and isAuthenticated. This could potentially expose sensitive information in the console.
- Fix: Remove or replace console.log statements with a secure logging mechanism.

**src/components/WalletConnect.tsx**
- The code uses the navigator.clipboard API to copy the user's address to the clipboard. This could potentially be used to steal the user's address.
- Fix: Consider adding a permission prompt or using a more secure method to copy the address to the clipboard.

**src/pages/App.tsx**
- The code uses the 'useAccount' hook from 'wagmi' without checking if the account is connected before calling other hooks that rely on the account being connected.
- Fix: Add a check to ensure the account is connected before calling other hooks that rely on the account being connected.

**src/hooks/useImmer.tsx**
- The type parameter S in the useImmer function is not correctly constrained, it should be constrained to be the same type as the type parameter T in the DraftFunction and Updater types
- Fix: Change the type parameter S to be the same type as T

**src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
- The code uses HTTP instead of HTTPS for API requests, which can expose sensitive data to eavesdropping and tampering.
- Fix: Update the API_BASE_URL to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

## 游리 MEDIUM

**src/components/WalletConnect.tsx**
- The code uses multiple useState hooks to manage different states. This could lead to performance issues if the component is complex or has many re-renders.
- Fix: Consider using a state management library like Redux or MobX to simplify state management.

**src/components/WalletConnect.tsx**
- The code catches errors but only logs them to the console. This could make it difficult to diagnose and fix issues.
- Fix: Consider implementing a more robust error handling mechanism, such as displaying error messages to the user or sending error reports to a server.

**src/components/test/Index.tsx**
- Missing dependency 'signer' in the 'handleUpdate' function
- Fix: Import or define the 'signer' variable

**src/components/common/PageNotFoundView.tsx**
- Using window.history.back() can be a security risk if the user came from an external site, as it could potentially lead to a phishing attack or other malicious behavior.
- Fix: Consider using a more secure approach, such as redirecting to a known safe page within the application.

**src/components/common/Loading.tsx**
- The 'color' property in the 'LoadingProps' interface is defined as a string, but it seems to be expecting a specific class name. It would be better to define it as a specific type or enum.
- Fix: Define the 'color' property as a specific type or enum, such as 'text-blue-600' | 'text-red-600', etc.

**src/components/common/Header.tsx**
- The code does not handle potential security vulnerabilities related to wallet connections, such as phishing or unauthorized access.
- Fix: Implement proper security measures, such as input validation and secure wallet connection protocols, to protect user wallets.

**src/pages/App.tsx**
- The code uses multiple 'useReadContract' and 'useWriteContract' hooks without memoizing the results, which can lead to unnecessary re-renders and performance issues.
- Fix: Use the 'useMemo' hook to memoize the results of the 'useReadContract' and 'useWriteContract' hooks to prevent unnecessary re-renders.

**src/pages/App.tsx**
- The code does not handle errors that may occur when calling the 'useReadContract' and 'useWriteContract' hooks.
- Fix: Add error handling to the 'useReadContract' and 'useWriteContract' hooks to handle any errors that may occur.

**src/hooks/useImmer.tsx**
- The useImmer function does not handle the case where the initialValue is null or undefined
- Fix: Add a null check for the initialValue and throw an error or return a default value

**src/hooks/useImmer.tsx**
- The type of the updater function in the useCallback hook is not correctly typed, it should be typed as T | DraftFunction<T>
- Fix: Add the correct type for the updater function

**src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
- The code catches all errors and logs them to the console, but it does not provide any specific error messages or handling for different types of errors.
- Fix: Implement specific error handling for different types of errors, such as network errors or authentication errors.

**src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
- The code stores the authentication token in local storage, which can be vulnerable to XSS attacks.
- Fix: Consider using a more secure storage mechanism, such as a secure cookie or a token storage library.

## 游릭 LOW

**src/components/WalletConnect.tsx**
- The code has many nested conditional statements and complex logic. This could make the code harder to read and maintain.
- Fix: Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more manageable functions or components.

**src/components/WalletConnect.tsx**
- The code has many magic numbers and hardcoded values. This could make the code harder to understand and maintain.
- Fix: Consider defining constants or enums for these values to make the code more readable and maintainable.

**src/components/test/Index.tsx**
- Unused import statement for 'useImmer' from '@hooks/useImmer'
- Fix: Remove unused import statement

**src/components/test/Index.tsx**
- Unused variable 'CONTRACT_ADDRESS'
- Fix: Remove unused variable or use it in the code

**src/components/test/Index.tsx**
- Console log statements are used for debugging, consider removing them in production code
- Fix: Remove console log statements

**src/components/test/Index.tsx**
- Magic numbers are used in the code (e.g. '5777', '7', '36')
- Fix: Replace magic numbers with named constants

**src/components/test/Index.tsx**
- The 'handleUpdate' function is not handling any potential errors
- Fix: Add error handling to the 'handleUpdate' function

**src/components/test/Index.tsx**
- The 'useEffect' hook is missing a cleanup function
- Fix: Add a cleanup function to the 'useEffect' hook

**src/components/common/PageNotFoundView.tsx**
- The button and link elements do not have explicit 'role' attributes, which can affect screen reader functionality.
- Fix: Add 'role' attributes to the button and link elements to improve accessibility.

**src/components/common/PageNotFoundView.tsx**
- The 'handleBackClick' function is only used once, and could be defined inline for simplicity.
- Fix: Define the 'handleBackClick' function inline, or consider reusing it elsewhere in the application if it has broader utility.

**src/components/common/PageNotFoundView.tsx**
- The text content of the component is hardcoded in a specific language, which may not be suitable for internationalization.
- Fix: Consider using a localization library or approach to make the text content more flexible and adaptable to different languages and regions.

**src/components/common/Loading.tsx**
- The component name 'LoadingExample' is not consistent with the exported component name 'Loading'. It would be better to use the same name for consistency.
- Fix: Rename 'LoadingExample' to 'Loading'.

**src/components/common/Loading.tsx**
- There is an unused import of 'useState' from 'react'.
- Fix: Remove the unused import.

**src/components/common/Loading.tsx**
- The 'Loading' component is not necessary and can be removed. The 'LoadingExample' component can be exported directly.
- Fix: Remove the 'Loading' component and export 'LoadingExample' directly.

**src/components/common/Header.tsx**
- The handleConnectWallet function only toggles the isWalletConnected state without actually connecting or disconnecting a wallet.
- Fix: Implement the actual wallet connection logic in the handleConnectWallet function.

**src/components/common/Header.tsx**
- The isActiveRoute function only checks for exact pathname matches, which may not work for nested routes.
- Fix: Consider using a more robust routing library or implementing a more sophisticated route matching logic.

**src/components/common/Header.tsx**
- The code uses inline styles and conditional class names, which can make the code harder to read and maintain.
- Fix: Consider using a CSS-in-JS solution or a separate CSS file to manage styles and class names.

**src/components/common/Header.tsx**
- The code uses magic strings for class names and styles, which can make the code harder to understand and maintain.
- Fix: Consider defining constants or enums for class names and styles to improve code readability and maintainability.

**src/pages/Home.tsx**
- The React import is missing
- Fix: Add import React from 'react'; at the beginning of the file

**src/pages/DappTest.tsx**
- The component DappTest is not utilizing any React features and is simply returning a string
- Fix: Consider using a more complex React component or a simple HTML file if no React functionality is needed

**src/pages/App.tsx**
- The code has a large number of nested conditional statements, which can make it difficult to read and maintain.
- Fix: Consider breaking down the conditional statements into smaller, more manageable functions to improve code readability and maintainability.

**src/pages/App.tsx**
- The code has a large number of variables and functions defined in a single file, which can make it difficult to navigate and maintain.
- Fix: Consider breaking down the code into smaller, more focused files to improve code organization and maintainability.

**src/hooks/useImmer.tsx**
- The useImmer function has a complex type signature, it would be better to break it down into smaller more manageable parts
- Fix: Consider breaking down the type signature into smaller parts or using a more straightforward type signature

**src/hooks/useImmer.tsx**
- The useImmer function uses the immer library, it would be good to consider the implications of this dependency
- Fix: Consider the implications of using the immer library and whether it is necessary for the use case

**src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
- The code mixes authentication logic with API request logic, which can make it harder to maintain and test.
- Fix: Consider separating the authentication logic into its own module or file.

**src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
- The code uses inconsistent naming conventions and coding styles, which can make it harder to read and maintain.
- Fix: Consider following a consistent coding style and naming convention throughout the codebase.

**src/hooks/useAuth.ts**
- The code uses the `JSON.parse` method to parse the token string, which can be slow for large token strings.
- Fix: Consider using a faster parsing method, such as `JSON.parse` with a reviver function or a dedicated token parsing library.
